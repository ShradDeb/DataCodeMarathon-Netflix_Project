# DataCodeMarathon
I'm kicking off a coding marathon! Every week, I'll be working with a new dataset, from SQL to Python, and tackling a few key areas:
* Defining the problem. *
* Digging into Exploratory Data Analysis. *
* Implementing ML solutions. *
*  Considering the real-world impact.

# Project Description
Netflix is known for its work in data science, AI, and ML, particularly for building strong recommendation models and algorithms that understand customer behavior and patterns. Suppose you are working in a data-driven job role, and you have a dataset of more than 9,000 movies. You need to solve the following questions to help the company make informed business decisions accordingly.

What is the most frequent genre of movies released on Netflix?
Which has highest votes in vote avg column?
What movie got the highest popularity? what's its genre?
What movie got the lowest popularity? what's its genre?
Which year has the most filmmed movies?

# Project Findings and Summary:
# Q1. What is the most frequent genre in the dataset?

# Q2. What genres has highest votes?
     We have 25.5% of our dataset with popular votes (6520 rows). 
     Drama gets the highest popularity among fans by having more than 18.5% movies 
# Q3. What movie got the highest popularity? What's it's genre?
    Spider-Man: No Way Home has the highest popularity rate in our dataset and it has genres as Action, Adventure and Science Fiction
# Q3. What movie got the lowest popularity? What's it's genre?
